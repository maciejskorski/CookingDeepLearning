Neural network is trained in order to recognize worlds cuisines :-)

The data comes from Kaggle. 

The presented solution uses Pandas and Numpy to manipulate data, and the scikit-learn framework with Tensforflow as backend to train the network. It achieves a better score than a simple linear model (Logistic Regression).
